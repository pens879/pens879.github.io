	<p>Multiple Sclerosis is a neurodegenerative and inflammatory immune condition which causes problems throughout the body. Researchers happen to believe that Multiple Sclerosis causes the body's immune system to attack myelin, the insulating coating around nerve cells. As the myelin erodes, communication between nerve cells in the central nervous system is broken or disrupted. When this happens, parts of the body do not receive instructions from the central nervous system, the controlling system of the body. The central nervous system, in Multiple Sclerosis, is attacked by the personâ€™s own immune system; thus is the reason why MS is considered as an autoimmune disease</p>
