	<h1>Causes for MS</h1>
	
	
	<p>Scientists are not sure what causes MS, but people have been theorizing about what could possibly affect it. The environment surrounding a person and also the nutrition they have, seems to be key in diagnosing MS. People living near the equator have a lower percentage of being affected by MS. Some are to believe it is due to the extra sunlight, allowing the body to generate more vitamin D. Genetics also plays a role in the factors contributing to Multiple Sclerosis. Incidences of MS amongst family members are about 4%. That is high as only 0.15% of the general population has a risk of developing MS. Scientists are also suggesting that viral or bacterial infections may trigger the immune system to respond in a certain way, leading to Multiple Sclerosis.</p>
