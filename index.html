	<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease affecting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system">central nervous system</a> in oneâ€™s body. The term Multiple Sclerosis comes from the Latin multus and plica meaning "fold", and the Greek sklerosis meaning "hardening". In MS, the brain has complications in getting messages to the rest of the body. It can cause problems with vision, balance, muscle control, and other basic body functions. Researchers have little knowledge about multiple sclerosis, but treatment and research into the disease is rapidly increasing.</p>

	<h3>Types of Multiple Sclerosis</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Relapsing-remitting:</strong> Multiple Sclerosis comes and goes over time. Symptoms may be severe but then happen to disappear.</li>
		<li><strong>Secondary-progressive:</strong> After the first attack, the disease may start to progress into more deliberate ways.</li>
		<li><strong>Primary-progressive:</strong> People who develop Multiple Sclerosis later in their life. They happen to decline slowly, without having to face many ups and downs. </li>
		<li><strong>Progressive relapsing:</strong> Symptoms initially progress slowly but eventually worsen over time.</li>
